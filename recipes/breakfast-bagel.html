        <h4>FINE!</h4>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Bacon 2 slices</li>
            <li>Egg 1-2</li>
            <li>Bagel</li>
            <li>Cheddar cheese slices</li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
          <ol>
            <li>Set a stove eye to medium heat and allow a few minutes for your pan to heat up</li>
            <li>Apply a thin coat of butter to the pan, then crack your egg(s) and monitor</li>
            <li>Prepare your bacon! I use a microwave safe plate, a few paper towels and 1-2 minuets checking between until crispy, but people with more time can use an oven at 350 for ~30 minutes</li>
            <li>Place your bagel into a toaster and use your preferred setting to toast. I prefer toasting at the 4th setting!</li>
            <li>Around the time your bagel is perfectly toasted it should be time to flip your egg!</li>
            <li>Cheese up the top half of your bagel, this will give it a few minutes to become melty!</li>
            <li>Your egg should be done, assuming its no-longer translucent! Apply salt & pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Carefully <em>I said carefully</em> move your egg(s) to your beautifully toasted bagel</li>
            <li>Arrange your bacon, then... <strong>Crown.Your.King!</strong></li>
          </ol>
